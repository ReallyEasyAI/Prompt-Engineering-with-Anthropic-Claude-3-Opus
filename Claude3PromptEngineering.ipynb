Moreover, recycling creates jobs and stimulates the economy by providing raw materials for new products.

Recycling isn't just about being a tree-hugger; it's also about creating jobs and boosting the economy. That's right, your old soda cans and milk jugs could be the key to someone's employment. So, put on your eco-friendly cape and join the recycling revolution!

    "Last weak, I wanna described four design patterns for AI agentic workflows that I belief will drive significant progress this year: Reflection, Tool use, Planning and Multi-agent collaboration. Instead of have an LLM generate it's final output directly, an agentic workflow prompts the LLM multiple times, giving it opportunities to build step by step to higher-quality output. Here, I'd like to discuss Reflection. For a design pattern that’s relatively quick to implement, I've seen it lead to surprising performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may had the experience of prompting ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini, receiving unsatisfactory output, delivering critical feedback to help the LLM improve it's response, and then getting a better response. What if you automate the step of delivering critical feedback, so the model automatically criticizes its own output and improves it’s response? This is the crux of Reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the task of asking an LLM to write code. We can prompt it to generate the desired code directly to carry out some task X. After that, we can prompt it to reflect on its own output, perhaps as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s code intended for task X: [previously generated code] Check the code careful for correctness, style, and efficiency, and give constructive criticism for how to improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes this causes the LLM to spot problems and come up with constructive suggestions. Next, we can prompt the LLM with context including (i) the previously generated code and (ii) the constructive feedback, and ask it to use the feedback to rewrite the code. This can lead to a better response. Repeating the criticism/rewrite process might yield further improvements. This self-reflection process allows the LLM to spot gaps and improve its output on a variety of tasks including producing code, writing text, and answering questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can go beyond self-reflection by giving the LLM tools that help evaluate its output; for example, running its code through a few unit tests to check whether it generates correct results on test cases or searching the web to double-check text output. Then it can reflect on any errors it found and come up with ideas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we can implement Reflection using a multi-agent framework. I've found it convenient to create two different agents, one prompted to generate good outputs and the other prompted to give constructive criticism of the first agent's output. The resulting discussion between the two agents leads to improved responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection is a relatively basic type of agentic workflow, but I've been delighted by how much it improved my applications’ results in a few cases. I hope you will try it in your own work. If you’re interested in learning more about reflection, I recommend these papers: - Self-Refine: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback, by Madaan et al. (2023) - Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning, by Shinn et al. (2023) - CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive Critiquing, by Gou et al.

The paper argues that the AI safety movement is dominated by governments and corporations, in contrast with other research directions that aim to use AI to advance broader social good. It suggests that the notion of AI safety, as currently framed, has an uneasy relationship with transparency and other important principles for achieving societal good.
